# Otherworldly 3D Knapsack Simulator

An immersive, artistically stunning visualization of the dynamic programming Knapsack algorithm. This project transforms an abstract algorithm into a breathtaking 3D experience where mathematical elegance meets cutting-edge visual design.

## Features

- **Mesmerizing 3D Environment**: Volumetric cosmic nebula, particle systems, and dynamic lighting
- **Interactive Algorithm Visualization**: Step through the dynamic programming solution with visual feedback
- **Dimensional Portal Knapsack**: Items interact with a dimensional portal that visualizes capacity
- **Crystalline Item Artifacts**: Sacred geometry forms represent items with value/weight relationships
- **Cosmic Architecture**: Dynamic Programming table visualized as floating monoliths in 3D space

## Technology Stack

- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **Three.js & React Three Fiber**: Core 3D rendering with React integration
- **R3F Ecosystem**: Drei, Postprocessing for advanced effects
- **Zustand**: State management for the application
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling
- **Custom WebGL Shaders**: GLSL for advanced visual effects

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.0.0 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/knapsack-simulator.git
cd knapsack-simulator
```
